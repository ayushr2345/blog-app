This repo contains the frontend of the [Tweeter](https://ayushr2345.github.io/Tweeter) web app. The main repo can be visited [here](https://github.com/ayushr2345/blog-app)

## Frontend

The frontend uses ReactJS with bootstrap and MUI icons in it. The frontend allows users to perform CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on their blogs and their account. The app asks for an email which would be unique and the name, password for authentication. The front end is responsive to laptops and mobile screens
